*Parent repository for tracking and coordinating database application development*

**IMPORTANT:** This is a **PARENT REPOSITORY ONLY** — it contains documentation and tracking but NO implementation code.

== Overview

This repository serves as the central tracking hub for the Next-Gen Databases initiative — a coordinated effort to build specialised database applications across different domains, each with its own query language, storage engine, and web interface.

**All database implementations are in their respective canonical repositories.**

== Database Portfolio

[cols="1,2,2,2,1"]
|===
| Database | Description | Technology | Query Language | Status

| *VeriSimDB*
| Cross-system entity consistency engine — 8 modalities (octad), drift detection, self-normalisation, formally verified queries. **Primary database project.** Operates as standalone database OR federation coordinator over existing databases (PostgreSQL, ArangoDB, Elasticsearch).
| Rust (core) + ReScript (VQL parser) + Elixir (orchestration)
| VQL (VeriSim Query Language) + VQL-DT (dependent types)
| Active — beta

| *QuandleDB*
| Knot-theory database — stores knots as Gauss codes, computes invariants (Jones polynomial, genus, Seifert circles), queries by topological properties. **Exploratory/research project**: a thought experiment in applying knot theory to database design, not yet intended as a production tool.
| Julia (Skein.jl engine) + ReScript frontend
| KQL (Knot Query Language) — in development
| Exploratory

| *LithoGlyph*
| Narrative-first, reversible, audit-grade database core for journalism, narrative arts, and media/comms. Working towards production but **secondary priority** to VeriSimDB. Long-term vision: intimate integration with portfolio tools (bofig, etc.) for journalism and PR applications.
| Forth (storage) + Zig (bridge) + Factor (FQL) + Idris2 (proofs) + Lean 4 (normalizer)
| GQL (Glyph Query Language) — planned
| Active — on backburner

| *Glyphbase*
| Web interface for LithoGlyph — browser-based search, visualisation, and annotation of glyph specimens
| ReScript frontend + LithoGlyph API
| (via LithoGlyph)
| Planned

|===

[NOTE]
====
**Project priorities:** VeriSimDB is the primary database engineering project, receiving active development focus. LithoGlyph is working towards production for specialist use in journalism and narrative arts, but is secondary priority while VeriSimDB matures. QuandleDB is a research exploration into knot theory's applications in database design — valuable for the mathematical insights but not positioned as a production tool at this stage.

Lessons learned from VeriSimDB development (drift detection, formal verification, federation) will directly improve LithoGlyph when development focus returns to it.

== Architecture

Each database in the portfolio follows a layered architecture:

----
  Query Language (DSL)
       ↓
  Database Engine (storage, indexing, computation)
       ↓
  HTTP API Server (JSON endpoints)
       ↓
  Web Frontend (ReScript SPA)
----

=== Common Patterns

* *Engines* are domain-specific libraries (Julia, Rust, Elixir)
* *APIs* expose JSON endpoints wrapping engine queries
* *Frontends* are ReScript + React SPAs with TEA-style state management
* *Query languages* are typed DSLs parsed with ReScript or domain-native parsers
* *Databases* use SQLite or custom storage depending on domain needs
